# Hash Map

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-hashmap) and it focuses on implementing a basic hash map data structure in JavaScript.<br />
A hash map, also known as a hash table, is a fundamental data structure used in computer science to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
This project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding hash map and their operations, providing practical experience in implementing and using this important data structure.

### Features

-   Set: Add a key-value pair to the hash map.
-   Get: Retrieve the values associated with a given key.
-   Has: Check if a key exists in the hash map.
-   Remove: Remove a key-value pair from the hash map.
-   Keys: Return an array containing all the keys in the hash map.
-   Values: Return an array containing all the values in the hash map.
-   Entries: Return an array containing all the key-value pairs in the hash map as nested arrays.
-   Length: Return the number of key-value pairs stored in the hash map.
-   Clear: Remove all entries form the hash map.

### Technologies Used

-   JavaScript (ES6)
-   Node.js (for running JavaScript code)

## Usage

To get started with the LinkedList project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ExtF8/projectHashMap.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd projectHashMap
    ```
3. Running Tests:

-   The `script.js` file contains test cases for the LinkedList implementation.
-   To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
-   This command will execute the test script and display the results in the console.
-   You can modify the `script.js` file to add or customize test cases as needed.
